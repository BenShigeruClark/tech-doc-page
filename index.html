            The Digitakt is a compact drum machine made by Elektron. A digitally and highly flexible sound engine, sampling capability
            , live-friendly sequencer, the means to control external MIDI gear, and Overbridge support. The Digitakt contains all the 
            necessary tools to make people move to a beat.  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Audio material handled by the Digitakts sample engine appears big, full and almost three-dimensional. 
              Sample everything you can. Your studio gear, random clips from YouTube, everyday life. Process and sequence.
              Digitakt is a sound exploration tool!
            </li>
            <li>
              The streamlined approach makes beat making a focused activity. This clarity is one of the core features of 
              Digitakt, and gives it a unique character. Being drawn into the Digitakt universe is a very enjoyable experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy sampling, sequencing of both audio and MIDI, the flexible sample engine, and Overbridge support form a very versatile product.
              The provided feature set allows for depth and adaptability, and also bestows Digitakt with a certain free-spiritedness. 
              Something, somehow, this drum machine feels alive.

            The sequencer of the Digitakt stores information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the audio tracks,
            the MIDI tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Each of the eight banks, A to H, contains 16
            patterns, which means 128 patterns are available for each project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digitakt can seamlessly switch between patterns. this, together with the ability to chain patterns, is a handy feature when improvising
            live. When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern position will be shown flashing in the 
            upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will start, and the pattern position will cease to flash.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a pattern is selected, and before releasing any key, [RECORD], [PLAY] and [STOP] can be 
              pressed to copy, clear or paste patterns without leaving the active pattern. It is possible to 
              clear and paste multiple patterns at the same time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Press [PLAY] to start the playback of a pattern. Press [STOP] to stop the playback of all tracks. The 
            sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have 
            faded out. When the sequencer has stopped, quickly press [STOP] + [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks
            and get just a short fade out the send effects.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a pattern is plaing and [PLAY] is pressed, playback will pause. Press [PLAY] again to resume the playback.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the PATTERN PAGE LEDs will indicate this. When a pattern
              is playing, the currently active pattern page is shown with a flashing PATTERN PAGE LED.
            </li>
            <li>
              The tempo is set in the TEMPO menu. Press [TEMPO] to open this menu.
