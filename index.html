            The Digitakt is a compact drum machine made by Elektron. A digitally and highly flexible sound engine, sampling capability
            , live-friendly sequencer, the means to control external MIDI gear, and Overbridge support. The Digitakt contains all the 
            necessary tools to make people move to a beat.  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Audio material handled by the Digitakts sample engine appears big, full and almost three-dimensional. 
              Sample everything you can. Your studio gear, random clips from YouTube, everyday life. Process and sequence.
              Digitakt is a sound exploration tool!
            </li>
            <li>
              The streamlined approach makes beat making a focused activity. This clarity is one of the core features of 
              Digitakt, and gives it a unique character. Being drawn into the Digitakt universe is a very enjoyable experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Easy sampling, sequencing of both audio and MIDI, the flexible sample engine, and Overbridge support form a very versatile product.
              The provided feature set allows for depth and adaptability, and also bestows Digitakt with a certain free-spiritedness. 
              Something, somehow, this drum machine feels alive.

          <p>
            The sequencer of the Digitakt stores information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the audio tracks,
            the MIDI tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Each of the eight banks, A to H, contains 16
            patterns, which means 128 patterns are available for each project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digitakt can seamlessly switch between patterns. this, together with the ability to chain patterns, is a handy feature when improvising
            live. When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern position will be shown flashing in the 
            upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will start, and the pattern position will cease to flash.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a pattern is selected, and before releasing any key, [RECORD], [PLAY] and [STOP] can be 
              pressed to copy, clear or paste patterns without leaving the active pattern. It is possible to 
              clear and paste multiple patterns at the same time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Press [PLAY] to start the playback of a pattern. Press [STOP] to stop the playback of all tracks. The 
            sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have 
            faded out. When the sequencer has stopped, quickly press [STOP] + [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks
            and get just a short fade out the send effects.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a pattern is plaing and [PLAY] is pressed, playback will pause. Press [PLAY] again to resume the playback.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the PATTERN PAGE LEDs will indicate this. When a pattern
              is playing, the currently active pattern page is shown with a flashing PATTERN PAGE LED.
            </li>
            <li>
              The tempo is set in the TEMPO menu. Press [TEMPO] to open this menu.

          <p>
            Digitakt offers two main modes of input when editing or creating a pattern, GRID RECORDING mode and LIVE RECORDING mode. 
            In these modes, two types of trigs can be entered: note trigs and lock trigs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action on the Digitakt. 
              There are two types of trigs that you can use, note trigs and lock trigs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note trigs trigger souns or MIDI notes. Lock trigs triggers parameter locks, but without triggering notes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note trigs are idicated by red [TRIG] keys and lock trigs are indicated by yellow [TRIG] keys. Unlit [TRIG] keys indicate steps that does not contain any trigs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enter GRID RECORDING mode by pressing the [RECORD] key. The [RECORD] key lights up red to indicate that GRID RECORDING mode is active.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing and holding [TRACK] and then one of the [TRIG] keys. A red [TRIG] key indicates the active track.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place note trigs on the sequencer using the sixteen [TRIG] keys. To add a lock trig, press [FUNCTION] and [TRIG]. Lock trigs may be entered on any step of the 
              sequencer, including ones that contains note trigs. Quickly pressing the [TRIG] key of any of the trigs entered will remoe the trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key of a 
              trig and holding it slightly longer will prepare the trig for editng, rather than removing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Add micro timeing to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys [LEFT] or [RIGHT].
          </p>
          <p>
            LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the [TRIG] keys are played in real time to input trigs to the tracks. 
            You can also use CHROMATIC mode to add note trigs chromatically. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE RECORDING mode can be 
            automatically quantized or not. Non-quantized trigs can be quantized after they are recorded, by using the QUANTIZE menu that is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG].
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. Quickly pressing [PLAY] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed will activate/deactivate 
              automatic quantizaion of LIVE RECORDING. The sequencer starts to play, and the [RECORD] key starts to flash red.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enter trigs in real time by tapping the [TRIG] keys. If CHROMATIC mode is active, the pitch value of the note trig will be recorded according to which [TRIG] key is 
              pressed. Any changes to PARAMETER page settings, using the DATA ENTRY knobs, will be recorded as parameter locks and add lock trigs where needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [PLAY] to exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing. if LIVE RECORDING mode is active and [RECORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [STOP] to stop both recording and playback of the sequencer. To exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keepng the sequencer playing, pres [PLAY].
            </li>
          </ul>
