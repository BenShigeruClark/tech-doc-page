          <p>
            The sequencer of the Digitakt stores information in patterns. A pattern controls the playback of the audio tracks,
            the MIDI tracks and various pattern-specific aspects of the tracks. Each of the eight banks, A to H, contains 16
            patterns, which means 128 patterns are available for each project.
          </p>
          <p>
            Digitakt can seamlessly switch between patterns. this, together with the ability to chain patterns, is a handy feature when improvising
            live. When a pattern is playing, and a new pattern is selected, the new pattern position will be shown flashing in the 
            upper left corner of the screen. Once the last step of the pattern has played, the new pattern will start, and the pattern position will cease to flash.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              patterns can be changed while the sequencer is running.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patterns can be changed and queued by sending program change messages.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a pattern is selected, and before releasing any key, [RECORD], [PLAY] and [STOP] can be 
              pressed to copy, clear or paste patterns without leaving the active pattern. It is possible to 
              clear and paste multiple patterns at the same time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Press [PLAY] to start the playback of a pattern. Press [STOP] to stop the playback of all tracks. The 
            sound will be cut off, but effects like Delay will continue to be audible until the delay repeats have 
            faded out. When the sequencer has stopped, quickly press [STOP] + [STOP] to stop playback of all tracks
            and get just a short fade out the send effects.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When a pattern is plaing and [PLAY] is pressed, playback will pause. Press [PLAY] again to resume the playback.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a pattern contains more than 16 sequencer steps, the PATTERN PAGE LEDs will indicate this. When a pattern
              is playing, the currently active pattern page is shown with a flashing PATTERN PAGE LED.

          <p>
            Digitakt offers two main modes of input when editing or creating a pattern, GRID RECORDING mode and LIVE RECORDING mode. 
            In these modes, two types of trigs can be entered: note trigs and lock trigs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A trig is a sequencer event that you can place when you want the sequencer to perform an action on the Digitakt. 
              There are two types of trigs that you can use, note trigs and lock trigs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note trigs trigger souns or MIDI notes. Lock trigs triggers parameter locks, but without triggering notes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Note trigs are idicated by red [TRIG] keys and lock trigs are indicated by yellow [TRIG] keys. Unlit [TRIG] keys indicate steps that does not contain any trigs. 
          </p>
          <p>
            GRID RECORDING is a method of composing where you use the [TRIG] keys to add trigs.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enter GRID RECORDING mode by pressing the [RECORD] key. The [RECORD] key lights up red to indicate that GRID RECORDING mode is active.
            </li>
            <li>
              Select the track to which you want to add trigs by pressing and holding [TRACK] and then one of the [TRIG] keys. A red [TRIG] key indicates the active track.
            </li>
            <li>
              Place note trigs on the sequencer using the sixteen [TRIG] keys. To add a lock trig, press [FUNCTION] and [TRIG]. Lock trigs may be entered on any step of the 
              sequencer, including ones that contains note trigs. Quickly pressing the [TRIG] key of any of the trigs entered will remoe the trig. Pressing a [TRIG] key of a 
              trig and holding it slightly longer will prepare the trig for editng, rather than removing it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [PLAY] to listen to the sequence.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Add micro timeing to a note trig by pressing and holding the [TRIG] key while pressing [ARROW] keys [LEFT] or [RIGHT].
          </p>
          <p>
            LIVE RECORDING mode is the second method of adding trigs to the tracks. In this recording mode, the [TRIG] keys are played in real time to input trigs to the tracks. 
            You can also use CHROMATIC mode to add note trigs chromatically. It is also possible to enter parameter locks in real time. Trigs input in LIVE RECORDING mode can be 
            automatically quantized or not. Non-quantized trigs can be quantized after they are recorded, by using the QUANTIZE menu that is accessed by pressing [FUNC] + [TRIG].
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Press and hold [RECORD], then press [PLAY] to enter LIVE RECORDING mode. Quickly pressing [PLAY] twice while keeping the [RECORD] key pressed will activate/deactivate 
              automatic quantizaion of LIVE RECORDING. The sequencer starts to play, and the [RECORD] key starts to flash red.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enter trigs in real time by tapping the [TRIG] keys. If CHROMATIC mode is active, the pitch value of the note trig will be recorded according to which [TRIG] key is 
              pressed. Any changes to PARAMETER page settings, using the DATA ENTRY knobs, will be recorded as parameter locks and add lock trigs where needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [PLAY] to exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keeping the sequencer playing. if LIVE RECORDING mode is active and [RECORD] is pressed, GRID RECORDING mode will be activated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press [STOP] to stop both recording and playback of the sequencer. To exit LIVE RECORDING mode while keepng the sequencer playing, pres [PLAY].
            </li>

            Here you can add micro timing to a note trig, moving it ahead or behind the beat. Micro timing can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on both
            audio and MIDI tracks In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] to access the pop-up Micro timing 
            menu that shows the time offset for the chosen sequencer step(s) on the acitve trak. To exit the micro timing menu, release the [TRIG] key(s). The micro 
            timing settings are stored in the active pattern. MICRO TIMING Press [LEFT]/[RIGHT] keys to adjust the time offset.

          <p>
            Retrigs can be customized on any of the sequencer steps on the audio tracks. In GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold one or several [TRIG] keys and then 
            press [UP]/[DOWN] to access the pop-up Retrig menu that shows the retrig actions for the chosen sequencer step(s) on the active track. To exit the Retrig menu, 
            release the [trig] key(s). The retrig sttings are stored in the active patern.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              RETRIG turns the retrig lock ON/OFF. When on, the retrig will activate whenever the [TRIG] key of the active track is pressed. Use DATA ENTRY knob A to turn retrig on/off.
            </li>
            <li>
              RATE Sets the retrig rate(1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10, 1/12, 1/16, 1/20, 1/24, 1/32, 1/40, 1/48, 1/64, or 1/80). 1/16 is the nominal retrig rate, one trig per step. 
              1/32 corresponds to two trigs per step and so on. To trig triplets, for examle, set the retrig rate to 1/12 (or 1/24). You can also press the [UP]/[DOWN] keys when you are in the 
              retrig menu to adjust the rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              LEN Sets the duration of the retrig velocity curve in fractions of, or rational or integer multiples of, a step (0,125-INF). 1/16 is the nominal length of one step. This setting 
              affects the behavior of the velocit curve by defining the boundaries of its envelope.
            </li>
            <li>
              VEL Sets the velocity curve fade out/fade in of the retrig (-128-127). -128 corresponds to a complete fade out during the set length, -64 fades out to half the velocity during the 
              set length, 0 equals a flat velocity curve with no fade, 64 fades into half velocity during the set length and 127 fades in completely for full velocity during the set length.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Retrigs can be recorded on the sequencer in GRID RECORDING mode as well as in LIVE RECORDING mode. they are recorded as separate trigs. If the retrig speed is greater than the 
            duration of a sequencer step, trigs are created with additional internal steps (i.e. steps with retrig enabled).

            The length and timing of the pattern and track is set in this menu. The SCALE menu has two modes. In LENGTH PER PATTERN mode all tracks share the same length. In LENGTH PER TRACK 
            mode each track can have different lengths. Access the SCALE menu by pressing [FUNC] + [PAGE]. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to toggle between the two SCALE modes. Use the DATA ENTRY knobs 
            to adjust the different settings.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LENGTH PER PATTERN MODE  is the default mode. In this mode, all tracks of the pattern share the same length and time signature.
            </li>
            <li>
              LENGTH controls the step length of the pattern. The leftmost number displays the number of steps in the pattern. The maximum number of steps available in the pattern is determined by 
              the total length, set by the second number. This can be either 16, 32, 48 or 64 steps. If 17 steps or more are used in a pattern, the [PAGE] key is, while in GRID RECORDING mode, 
              used to toggle between the different pattern pages. 
            </li>
            <li>
              SCALE controls the time signature of the pattern. It offers seven possible settings, 1/8X 1/4X, 1/2X, 3/4X, 1X, 3/2X AND 2X. A setting of 1/8X will play back the pattern at one-eighth 
              of the set tempo. 3/4X plays the pattern back at three-quarters of the tempo, 3/2X wil play back the pattern twice as fast as the 3/4X setting. 2X will make the pattern play at twice the BPM.
            </li>
            <li>
              Trigs are automatically copied when extending the length of a pattern. If a pattern consists of for example two pages and the pattern length is increased to four pages, the two additional pattern 
              pages will be copies of the first two pattern pages. Press the [PAGE] key to change the total length of the pattern quickly. Press the [TRIG] keys to change the number of steps of the pattern quickly. 
              A 2X time signature setting is useful for increasing the base resolution of the step sequencer to 32nd notes. A 3/4X setting is useful when Digitakt is playing alongside other instruments set to the 
              same BPM, and you want Digitakt to play triplets.
            </li>
            <li>
              In LENGTH PER TRACK MODE, the tracks of the pattern can be assigned individual lengths. Press [FUNC] + [YES] to switch between the two scale modes. In this mode, two columns exist, TRACK and PATTERN. 
              The TRACK column sets the step length of the track. It works just like setting the patern length in LENGTH PER PATTERN mode. The settings will only affect the active track. Press the [TRK] keys to select 
              the track whose scale settings will be edited. The PATTERN column sets the master length, the master change length and the general time signature of the pattern.

            Parameter locks makes it possible to set every trig to have its own unique parameter values. The note trigs of an audio track can, for example, have differnet pitch, amp or filter settings. It is possible to 
            parameter lock the parameters found on the PARAMETER pages, and you can apply parameter locks to all types of tracks. To apply parameter locks in GRID RECORDING mode, press and hold the [TRIG] key of a trig. 
            Use the DATA ENTRY knobs to adjust the parameters you want to locks. The graphics become inverted for the locked parameter, and the locked parameter values are displayed. The [TRIG] key of the locked trig blinks 
            red or yellow to indicate the trig now contains a parameter lock.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the trig page, there is a parameter called COND (Trig Condition) with which a set of conditional rules can be applied to any trig, using a parameter lock. Each setting is a logical condition that will determine 
            whether a trig set in the sequencer will be triggered or not. If the condition is true then the trig will trigger and affect the sequence. You must first place a trig to where you want to apply a conditional lock. 
            The sequencer needs to be in FILL mode to activate the conditional locks call FILL. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conditional parameter locks are a great way to add variety to a pattern. To set up a grid of mutually exclusive or conclusive note trigs across any of the synth tracks, and throwing some probability locks in there 
              as well (also sporting an array of logically conditioned trigs), is a great way to make the most minimal of compositions come alive with randomness.
            </li>
            <li>
              Note that random or arbitrary variety, while fun and interesting, is not the only way of using conditional trigs. They may also be used, for example, to have two different melodic or percussive sequences on the 
              same track, one of  which is activated only when FILL mode is active.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Press [YES] + [PAGE] to activate FILL mode for one pattern cycle. It will become active when the pattern loops and remains active until it loops again. You can also activate FILL mode at any time, and for any duration, 
            by pressing and holding the [PAGE] key when the pattern is playing (GRID RECORDING mode cannot be active). The FILL mode is active for as long as the key is held.
          </p>
          <p>
            Adjust the swing setting of the pattern, to emeploy a propulsive, rhythmic groove. Press [TEMPO] to access this menu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patterns, tracks, track pages, and trigs can be copied pasted and cleared. The active pattern can be copied to either another location in the same bank or to a location in another bank. To perform a pattern copy operation, 
            GRID RECORDING mode must be deactivated. Copy the pattern by pressing [FUNC] + [RECORD]. Select another pattern and paste the copied pattern to this location by pressing [FUNC] + [STOP]. The operation can be undone by pressing 
            [FUNC] + [STOP] again. Clear a pattern by pressing [FUNC] + [PLAY]. Undo the operation by repeating the key presses. Individual sequencer tracks can be copied, pasted and cleared in the same way as patterns. To do so, GRID RECORDING 
            mode must be active.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trigs, complete with all parameter lock settings, can be copied, pasted and cleared as well. GRID RECORDING mode needs to be active to access this functionality. Press and hold a trig and press [RECORD] to perform the copy operation. 
            Paste by holding another [TRIG] key and pressing [STOP]. It is also possible to copy more than one trig. Hold several trigs and press [RECORD]. The trig first pressed will act as the starting point. When pasting, the other copied trigs 
            will be place in relation to this trig. Paste the copied sequence of trigs by holding another [TRIG] key and pressing [STOP]. Clear trig locks by holding one or more trigs and press [PLAY].

          <p>
            Chains are sequences that consist of more than one pattrern. You can use chains to preselect and automate in what order you want your patterns to play. You can create one chain in the current active bank. You can use the 16 patterns 
            within that bank to create the chain. The chain can consist of up to 64 pattern entries.
          </p>
          <p>
            Press [BANK] + [TRIG] key to select bank. Press and hold [PTN] and then press a [TRIG 1-16] key to select the first pattern in the chain. Release the [PTN] key and then press [trig 1-16] keys in the same order a you want the chained 
            patterns to play. Keep the previous [TRIG] key preessed while you press the next one, the one after that and so on, so that the sequencer can recognize tht you're building a chain and not just switching patterns. You can press the same  
            [TRIG] key again if you wish to add the pattern multiple times in a row. Press [PLAY] to start the sequencer and play the chain. The chain will be looped once the final pattern of the chain has played.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Note that the chain will be lost when you create a new chain or when you selet a new bank/pattern. Also, chains cannot be saved and will be lost when you switch the Digitakt off.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chains can be created while the sequencer is running.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can also use MIDI program change messages from an external device to change patterns on the Digitakt.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You are now ready to use the Digitakt sequencer!
